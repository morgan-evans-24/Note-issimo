# Note-issimo
Note-issimo is a simple markdown note-taking app built using React and Bootstrap. This app was never hosted anywhere, but was just a small project to help me build my skills with React.

## Login
The login for the app is simple enough, just a basic sign-up/log-in method, with authentication handles by firebase.

## Notes Screen
The main screen of the app, notes are created and managed on the left hand side, and edited on the left. Notes headers can be changed in the right hand panel, as well as their content. The note editing panel has two modes: **Edit Mode** which allows the users to write to the content of the note in markdown, and **Read Mode**, which displays the rendered markdown text.

## Going Forward
Were I to continue working on this project, I would make the app compatible with mobile devices, as well as allow input for other languages such as LaTeX.
